# Google Clone Project

This is a Google Clone project that aims to replicate the appearance and basic functionality of the Google search page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The Google Clone project is a web application that mimics the look and feel of the Google search page. The project includes a search bar, search results, and Google's iconic "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. Users can enter search queries in the search bar and receive search results, which can be clicked to visit the corresponding websites.

The project uses HTML for creating the structure of the web page, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and functionality to the search bar and search results.
